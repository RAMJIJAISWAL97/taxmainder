        <h2>Patent</h2>
                <p>
                A patent is a legal document that gives an inventor exclusive rights to prevent others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a certain period of time.
                 In essence, a patent is a form of intellectual property protection that provides inventors with a legal monopoly on their invention.
                </p>
                <p> 
                Patents are granted by national patent offices, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the European Patent Office (EPO), to inventors who meet certain criteria, such as novelty, non-obviousness, and usefulness. Once a patent is granted, the inventor can prevent others from making, using, selling, and importing the invention for up to 20 years from the date of filing.
                </p>
                <p>
                Patent provide legal protection for inventors, patents also serve as a means of promoting innovation by providing inventors with an incentive to disclose their inventions to the public in exchange for exclusive rights. This disclosure allows others to learn from the invention and build upon it, furthering technological progress and promoting economic growth.
